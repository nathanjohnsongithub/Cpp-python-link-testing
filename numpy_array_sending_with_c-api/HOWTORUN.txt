To complile the c code and make a shared library you need to run the command 

#
gcc calculator.c -shared -o calculator.so -I<python-include-path> -I<numpy-include-path> -fPIC
#

to get the python include path you can run
#
python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()['include'])"    
#

to get the numpy include path you can run these commands in order

#
python
import numpy
numpy.get_include()
#
and copy what numpy.get_include() prints out

after you have the shared library you can just run the python program as normal
