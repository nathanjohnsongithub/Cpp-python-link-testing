To run the code all you need to do is run the python program

	#
	python linker.py
	#

To compile the c code into a shared library you will need to run the command

	#
	gcc calculator.c -shared -o calculator.so -I<python-include-path> -I<numpy-include-path> -fPIC
	#

to get the python include path you can run

	#
	python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()['include'])"    
	#


to get the numpy include path you can run these commands in order

	#
	python
	import numpy
	numpy.get_include()
	#
and copy what numpy.get_include() prints out

after you have the shared library you can just run the python program as normal
